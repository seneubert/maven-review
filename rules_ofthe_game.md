The maven review is a process concept. The [main description](README) explains a lot of the mental models on which the concept is founded.
Here we collect the few hard "rules" that are put in place mainly to provide a structure that everybody can agree to.

## Public Analysis shoppinglist (was backlog)
* Each analysis team maintains a public shoppinglist list (using a common tool, that everybody in LHCb understands)
* The shoppinglist should (*=must) contain
** logical steps of the analysis strategy (*)
** discussions of ideas, techniques, implementation issues
** features people are working on
** requests from reviewers (*)
** comments from the working group
* Items can be commented on, marked as finished and approved
* Anybody is allowed to add items

## Public analysis code
* The complete code of the analysis is made available to the collaboration in a version controll system
* The working group (reviewer) is responsible for checking that the code is complete and rworking 


## Working group reviewer (was maven)
* Is assigned to the analysis when it is presented in the working group
* Reviews the analysis and it's implementation
* Can hold the approval if the analysis code is not available / not working
